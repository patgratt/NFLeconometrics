# NFLeconometrics

## Project Overview:
My final group project for ECON 320 (Econometrics) at Emory Univeristy. In this project we ananlyzed the official team statistics from the 2016 NFL season. Our main goal was to use econometric estimation methods to determine which factors contributed most to a team's success. We built several multivariate linear regression models using ordinary least squares to estimate the unknown paramtters. Our primary conclusion was that turnover differential was the most important factor in predicting the wins of a given team.
